## easy21-RL: Reinforcement Learning applied to a Simple Game
This project applied various reinforcement learning techniques to the simple game "Easy21" described by
David Silver's RL course. 
Note: This project is _not_ the completed assignment, but uses several ideas from the assignment to spur more thorough analysis.

Several agents are implemented or are planned to be implemented, and analysis of their performance can be seen in the jupyter notebook file.

Naive Agents (Non-learning):
  Basic (Random Actions)
  Naive (Simple heuristic - stick on 16 or higher.
  
Algorithms implemented by learning agents:
  *Q-Learning (Monte-Carlo)
  *Q-Learning (Temporal Difference Learning)
  *SARSA
  *Policy Gradient
